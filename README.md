# cyclops

Cyclops is a Kubernetes cluster management tool. It provides you with a handy UI that helps you manage your applications
inside the cluster and makes it easier for you to track your cluster's state. Once installed, cyclops
will allow you to deploy, edit, scale, rollback, and delete all types of resources Kubernetes has to offer. While
making actions on your cluster easier, it helps you with the observability of
your cluster and applications by grouping meaningful resources and enabling you to observe all applications resources at
once.

The main benefit of using cyclops is for your engineers not to maintain their application's configurations through the Helm
templates, kustomize, or raw Kubernetes manifests, but to give them a UI they can use to alter their applications.

And finally, you might want to delete a deployment. Feel free to do it through Cyclops.
