# About Cyclops

## Introduction
Welcome to Cyclops, a powerful user interface for managing and interacting with Kubernetes clusters. Cyclops is 
designed to simplify the management of containerized applications on Kubernetes, providing an intuitive and 
user-friendly experience for developers, system administrators, and DevOps professionals. Divide the responsibility 
between your infrastructure and your developer teams so that everyone can play to their strengths. Automate your 
processes and shrink the window for deployment mistakes.

## What is Cyclops?
Cyclops is an innovative web-based tool designed to simplify the management of distributed systems, specifically 
focusing on the widely used Kubernetes platform. By providing a user-friendly interface, Cyclops abstracts complex 
Kubernetes configuration files into intuitive web forms, making it easier for developers to deploy applications and 
manage Kubernetes environments. It offers predefined fields and graphical representations of deployments, enhancing 
visibility and reducing the learning curve associated with Kubernetes. Cyclops aims to empower IT operations teams, 
DevOps teams, developers and business owners, enabling them to streamline processes, increase productivity, 
and achieve cost savings in managing Kubernetes clusters.

Cyclops provides a comprehensive dashboard that offers an overview of the cluster's health, performance, and resource
utilization. The dashboard presents key metrics and information about pods, nodes, deployments, services, and more,
enabling users to monitor the cluster's status at a glance.

With Cyclops, users can effortlessly deploy and scale their applications on the cluster. The application provides an
intuitive interface to create, manage, and update deployments, allowing users to easily adjust the number of replicas,
configure rolling updates, and monitor the deployment's progress.

Cyclops lets you create templates of YAML configuration files for your applications with variables that can be
assigned later. This empowers users to create parameterized and customizable configurations that can be easily
adapted to different environments or use cases. Templating YAML configuration files simplifies the management of
Kubernetes resources, promotes consistency, and streamlines the deployment process, making it more efficient and
adaptable to varying requirements.

Versioning templates provide a structured way to keep track of changes and updates made to templates over time. Each
version represents a specific iteration or snapshot of the template at a particular point in time. By using versioning,
it becomes easier to manage and track different versions of templates, facilitating collaboration, maintenance, and
rollback if necessary.

Helm has already established itself in the Kubernetes community as a tool for writing configuration files. We understand
that nobody likes to change the way they are doing things. To make the transition easier, we integrated Helm
into our system and made it possible to bring your old configuration files written with Helm into Cyclops. No need for
starting over, continue were you left off!

## Benefits

### Dividing Responsibilities
By dividing responsibilities, each team can work efficiently in their respective domains. The infrastructure team can 
dedicate their efforts to infrastructure optimization, scalability, and security, ensuring that the Kubernetes 
environment is robust and well-maintained. Simultaneously, the developer team can focus on delivering their product
without having to learn Kubernetes in depth. This division of responsibilities enhances collaboration and fosters a 
smoother development workflow.

### Easier Deployments
Using a form-based UI eliminates the need for manual configuration and command-line interactions, making the deployment 
process more user-friendly and accessible to individuals with varying levels of technical expertise. Advanced users can 
write their own configuration files, but we offer some basic templates for users still new to Kubernetes to help them 
start off.

### Productivity and Error Minimization
Cyclops deploys your applications trough forms with predefined fields. This means that your developers can edit only 
certain fields and input only values of certain type. Forms drastically shrink the window for deployment mistakes which
are often costly for businesses, both financially and reputation-wise. Developers do not need to know the intricacies 
of Kubernetes, only the basics, which in return will speed up their onboarding and bolster their productivity.

### Solidify Good Practices
Cyclops promotes consistency and standardization in deployment practices. By providing predefined templates or
configuration presets, Cyclops ensures that deployments adhere to established best practices and guidelines. This
consistency not only improves the reliability and stability of deployments but also facilitates collaboration among
team members who can easily understand and reproduce each other's deployments.

## Conclusion
Cyclops offers a streamlined and intuitive interface for managing Kubernetes clusters, simplifying complex operations 
and enabling efficient application orchestration. Whether you're new to Kubernetes or an experienced user, Cyclops 
empowers you to interact with your cluster effectively and enhances your productivity. Start leveraging the power of 
Kubernetes with a user-friendly experience through Cyclops.
