# About Cyclops

## Introduction

Welcome to Cyclops, a powerful user interface for managing and interacting with Kubernetes clusters. Cyclops is designed to simplify the management of containerized applications on Kubernetes, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience for developers, system administrators, and DevOps professionals.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of Cyclops is to enhance the usability and accessibility of Kubernetes by offering a graphical interface for cluster management. With Cyclops, users can perform common Kubernetes operations with ease, such as deploying applications, scaling resources, and monitoring cluster health.

## Features

### 1. Dashboard

Cyclops provides a comprehensive dashboard that offers an overview of the cluster's health, performance, and resource utilization. The dashboard presents key metrics and information about pods, nodes, deployments, services, and more, enabling users to monitor the cluster's status at a glance.

### 2. Deployments and Scaling

With Cyclops, users can effortlessly deploy and scale their applications on the cluster. The application provides an intuitive interface to create, manage, and update deployments, allowing users to easily adjust the number of replicas, configure rolling updates, and monitor the deployment's progress.

### 3. Templates

Cyclops lets you create templates of YAML configuration files for your applications with variables that can be assigned later. This empowers users to create parameterized and customizable configurations that can be easily adapted to different environments or use cases. Templating YAML configuration files simplifies the management of Kubernetes resources, promotes consistency, and streamlines the deployment process, making it more efficient and adaptable to varying requirements.

### 4. Versioning

Versioning templates provide a structured way to keep track of changes and updates made to templates over time. Each version represents a specific iteration or snapshot of the template at a particular point in time. By using versioning, it becomes easier to manage and track different versions of templates, facilitating collaboration, maintenance, and rollback if necessary.
