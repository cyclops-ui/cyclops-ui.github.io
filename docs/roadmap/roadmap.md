# Roadmap

We're thrilled to share that we are currently hard at work crafting the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of our 
groundbreaking new offering. Our dedicated team is pouring their expertise, creativity, and countless hours into 
building a solution that will revolutionize the way you manage your Kubernetes clusters.

The MVP represents a significant milestone in our journey, as it will serve as the initial version of our product that 
encompasses the core features and functionalities. This strategic approach allows us to gather valuable feedback from 
early users like yourself and shape the future development of the product based on real-world insights.
We intend to finish developing a stable version by the start of the next year.
